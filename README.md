#Step 1: Install Docker
Download Docker:

Go to the Docker website and download Docker Desktop for your operating system.
Install Docker:

Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
For Windows and Mac, run the installer.
For Linux, you can use the package manager to install Docker.
Verify Installation:

Open a terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows) and run:
```
sh
docker --version
```

#Step 2: Install Jenkins
Download Jenkins:

Go to the Jenkins website and download the Long-Term Support (LTS) version for your operating system.
Install Jenkins:

Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
For Docker, you can use the Jenkins Docker image:
```
sh
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins/jenkins:lts
```
Setup Jenkins:

Once Jenkins is running, open a web browser and go to http://localhost:8080.
Follow the setup wizard, using the initial admin password found in the Jenkins logs.
Install suggested plugins.

#Step 3: Create a Jenkins Pipeline
Open Jenkins Dashboard:

Go to http://localhost:8080 and log in.
Create a New Pipeline:

Click on New Item.
Enter a name for your pipeline, select Pipeline, and click OK.
Configure Pipeline:

In the pipeline configuration page, scroll down to the Pipeline section.
Select Pipeline script and enter your pipeline script. For example:
groovy
```
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building...'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing...'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying...'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Save and Build:

Click Save and then Build Now.
#Step 4: Set Up Docker Integration
Install Docker Plugin:

In Jenkins, go to Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins.
In the Available tab, search for Docker Pipeline and install it.
Configure Docker in Jenkins:

Go to Manage Jenkins > Global Tool Configuration.
Scroll down to Docker and add a new Docker installation if necessary.
Update Pipeline Script:

Modify your pipeline script to include Docker steps. For example:
groovy
```
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker { image 'maven:3.8.1-jdk-11' }
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean install'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'echo Deploying...'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
#Step 5: Generating Reports
Install Reporting Plugins:

In Jenkins, go to Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins.
In the Available tab, search for HTML Publisher and install it.
Configure HTML Report:

Update your pipeline script to publish HTML reports. For example:
groovy
```
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building...'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing...'
                // Assume test results are generated in target/site
                publishHTML([reportDir: 'target/site', reportFiles: 'index.html', reportName: 'HTML Report'])
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying...'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
View Reports:

After a build, you can view the HTML report from the Jenkins job page.

#Step 6: Documentation and Images
Documenting Steps:

Create a detailed document with the above steps.
Include screenshots of each step for better clarity.
Sample Images:
